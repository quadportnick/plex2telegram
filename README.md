# plex2telegram

This a script I use to announce new videos on Plex to a Telegram channel

Dumping this pretty much as is as it may be useful to someone else

Copy config.yaml.example to config.yaml and put in your values. Make sure there's a 'last_time' file is writable by whatever user runs the script
